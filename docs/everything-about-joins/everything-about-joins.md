## The tools/data in this course

This course will primarily use [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) as the database engine, but will also mention [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/?view=sql-server-ver16), and [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/).

The data will be made up for the examples.
