/*
    JOIN

    ON
    USING

    Join types:
    - INNER
    - LEFT (OUTER)
    - RIGHT (OUTER)
    - FULL (OUTER)

    - CROSS
    - POSITIONAL (DuckDB only)

    - LATERAL (Snowflake and DuckDB only)

    - SEMI (DuckDB 0.8+ only)
    - ANTI (DuckDB 0.8+ only)

    Modifiers:
    - NATURAL
    - ASOF (DuckDB only)

    Hints (SQL Server only, but all have something similar internally):
    - LOOP
    - HASH
    - MERGE

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    The JOIN clause is how we combine data from different tables in SQL.
    The JOIN syntax is ANSI SQL and, in some cases, extends the usual
    functionality of the non-ANSI joins.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    All 5 have the INNER, OUTER (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL), and CROSS join
    types, as well as the the ON clause.

    - DuckDB has it all ðŸ’™
    - SQLite also has USING and NATURAL
    - PostgreSQL also has USING and NATURAL
    - SQL Server doesn't have anything else
    - Snowflake also has USING, NATURAL, and LATERAL
