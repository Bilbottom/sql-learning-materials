/*
    GROUP BY [columns, ALL]

    FILTER  (after aggregate functions)
    HAVING  (after GROUP BY)

    Extensions:
    - ROLLUP
    - GROUPING SETS
    - CUBE

    Related functions:
    - GROUPING/GROUPING_ID

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    The GROUP BY clause is how we aggregate data in SQL.

    - DuckDB has it all ðŸ’™
    - SQLite only has FILTER and HAVING
    - PostgreSQL has everything except GROUP BY ALL
    - SQL Server doesn't have FILTER or GROUP BY ALL
    - Snowflake doesn't have FILTER
