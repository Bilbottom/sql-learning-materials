# SQL Learning Materials

> [!SUCCESS]

> SQL scripts that demonstrate various features and concepts.

This project contains a bunch of SQL learning materials aimed at different levels of experience and covering a variety of topics. It focuses on just writing `SELECT` statements so there will be very few resources for anything else.

## Acknowledgements

The data used in this project is from a couple of sources.

The SQL Server instance has the ubiquitous _AdventureWorks_ databases (the transactional one and the analytical one), which are available from various Microsoft pages:

- [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure)
- [https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks)

The PostgreSQL instance has the similarly ubiquitous _Sakila_ database, which is available from the following GitHub repo:

All credit for the data goes to the respective owners, and these sources should be consulted for any documentation you need around the data.
