# Updating SCD2 dimension ðŸ§®

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> You're working on a data pipeline that processes batches of data on a daily basis.
>
> The batch data contains only the latest information for existing records, and this particular pipeline pushes this data into a [slowly changing dimension type 2 (SCD2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_2:_add_new_row) table.

> [!QUESTION]
>
> Write a `SELECT` query which produces the updated target table by:
>
> - Adding a row for the new/changed records in the latest batch.
> - Updating the `valid_until` column for the existing records that have changed in the latest batch.
>   - Note: existing records that are no longer in the latest batch should count as changed (with no new row added).
>
> The output should have the same columns as the target table:
>
> - `...`
>
> Order the output by `...`.
