# Outstanding invoices ðŸ’±

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> A consulting firm, based in the US, works with clients all over the world.
>
> They invoice their clients in USD and are interested in the total amount outstanding in each local currency.

> [!QUESTION]
>
> Calculate the total amount outstanding (`is_paid = false`) in each local currency for the invoices in the `invoices` table.
>
> Use the `exchange_rates` table to convert the invoice amount (USD) to the local currency, using the latest exchange rate at the time of the invoice.
>
> The output should have a row per `invoice_currency` with the columns:
>
> - `invoice_currency`
> - `amount_outstanding` as the total amount outstanding in the local currency, _rounded up_ to two decimal places
>
> Order the output by `invoice_currency`.

>? TIP: **Hint 1**
>
> For databases that support it, use [an `ASOF` join](../../../everything-about-joins/syntax/timestamp-joins.md) to use the latest exchange rate for each invoice (as of the time of the invoice).
>
> For databases that don't support `ASOF` joins, use any other method to get the exchange rates for each invoice, such as a correlated subquery.

> Use the `CEIL` function (or equivalent) with the value to round multiplied by 100, then divide by 100 to round up to two decimal places.
