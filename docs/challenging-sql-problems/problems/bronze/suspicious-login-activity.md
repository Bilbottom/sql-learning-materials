# Suspicious login activity ðŸ¤”

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> A company is investigating suspicious login activity on their platform.
>
> Consecutive failed login attempts are considered suspicious once they reach a certain threshold, and the company wants to identify users who have reached this threshold.
>
> Their platform logs `login`, `logout`, and `login failed` events for each user.

> [!QUESTION]
>
> For the events below, identify the users who have `login failed` events at least five times in a row.
>
> Keep only the user ID and their _greatest_ number of consecutive failed login attempts.
>
> The output should have a row for each user who meets this criterion, with the columns:
>
> - `user_id`
> - `consecutive_failures` as the greatest number of consecutive failed login attempts for the user
>
> Order the output by `user_id`.

> Use the difference between two `ROW_NUMBER()` functions to create a group for each user and event type. Partition on `user_id` for one and partition on both `user_id` and `event_type` for the other, ordering both by `event_id`.
