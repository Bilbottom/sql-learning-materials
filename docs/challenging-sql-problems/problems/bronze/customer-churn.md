# Customer churn ðŸ”„

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> A social media platform wants to track customer churn by identifying users who have not been active recently.
>
> For performance reasons, the platform encodes the recent user activity in a "datelist int"; more details on this encoding can be found at:
>
> - [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/datelist-int-efficient-data-structure-user-growth-max-sung/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/datelist-int-efficient-data-structure-user-growth-max-sung/)

> [!QUESTION]
>
> Given the user history below, identify the users who have _churned_: who were inactive for the last 7 days, but active in the 7 days before that.
>
> Note that the `last_update` column will always have the same date for all users.
>
> The output should have one row for each churned user, with the columns:
>
> - `user_id`
> - `days_active_last_week` as the number of days the user was active in the last week
>
> Order the output by `user_id`.

A worked example is provided below to help illustrate the datelist int encoding.

### Worked example

To help understand the datelist int encoding, consider the following users:

| user_id | last_update | activity_history |
| ------: | :---------- | ---------------: |
|       1 | 2024-03-01  |               81 |
|       2 | 2024-03-01  |             2688 |
|       3 | 2024-03-01  |            13144 |

We'll walk through each user to understand which days they were active.

#### User 1

The `activity_history` for user 1 is `81`, which in binary is `1010001`.

The rightmost bit represents the most recent day, which is the `last_update` date: `2024-03-01`.

Since the rightmost bit is `1`, the user was active on that day.

We can apply the same logic to the other bits:

```
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | â””-- 2024-03-01 (active)
| | | | | â””---- 2024-02-29 (inactive)
| | | | â””------ 2024-02-28 (inactive)
| | | â””-------- 2024-02-27 (inactive)
| | â””---------- 2024-02-26 (active)
| â””------------ 2024-02-25 (inactive)
â””-------------- 2024-02-24 (active)
```

â””â”€
Since there are no more bits on the left, we can assume that the user was inactive on those days.

This user is therefore not a churned user since they were active at least once in the last 7 days.

#### User 2

The `activity_history` for user 2 is `2688`, which in binary is `101010000000`.

We can expand the binary representation to understand the activity again:

```
1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
| | | | | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | | â””-- 2024-03-01 (inactive)
| | | | | | | | | | â””---- 2024-02-29 (inactive)
| | | | | | | | | â””------ 2024-02-28 (inactive)
| | | | | | | | â””-------- 2024-02-27 (inactive)
| | | | | | | â””---------- 2024-02-26 (inactive)
| | | | | | â””------------ 2024-02-25 (inactive)
| | | | | â””-------------- 2024-02-24 (inactive)
| | | | â””---------------- 2024-02-23 (active)
| | | â””------------------ 2024-02-22 (inactive)
| | â””-------------------- 2024-02-21 (active)
| â””---------------------- 2024-02-20 (inactive)
â””------------------------ 2024-02-19 (active)
```

User 2 _has_ churned user since they were not active in the last 7 days (between `2024-02-24` and `2024-03-01`) but were active at least once in the 7 days before that.

#### User 3

The `activity_history` for user 3 is `13144`, which in binary is `11001101011000`.

We can expand the binary representation to understand the activity again:

```
1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
| | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | | | | â””-- 2024-03-01 (inactive)
| | | | | | | | | | | | â””---- 2024-02-29 (inactive)
| | | | | | | | | | | â””------ 2024-02-28 (inactive)
| | | | | | | | | | â””-------- 2024-02-27 (active)
| | | | | | | | | â””---------- 2024-02-26 (active)
| | | | | | | | â””------------ 2024-02-25 (inactive)
| | | | | | | â””-------------- 2024-02-24 (active)
| | | | | | â””---------------- 2024-02-23 (inactive)
| | | | | â””------------------ 2024-02-22 (active)
| | | | â””-------------------- 2024-02-21 (active)
| | | â””---------------------- 2024-02-20 (inactive)
| | â””------------------------ 2024-02-19 (inactive)
| â””-------------------------- 2024-02-18 (active)
â””---------------------------- 2024-02-17 (active)
```

Like user 1, user 3 is not a churned user since they were active at least once in the last 7 days.
