# Decoding datelist ints 🔐

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> The same social media platform from the [customer churn](../bronze/customer-churn.md) problem wants to view their user activity in a more human-readable format.

> [!QUESTION]
>
> Explode the user activity into a table with one row per day and a column for each user, showing whether they were active.
>
> The number of rows to show in the output should be the number of days in the `activity_history` column for the user with the most days.
>
> The output should have a single row per day with the columns:
>
> - `active_date` as the date of the activity, starting from the `last_update` date
> - `user_X` which is `1` if `user_id = X` was active on that day, `0` otherwise
>
> ...where `X` is each `user_id` in the activity table.
>
> Order the output by `active_date`.
