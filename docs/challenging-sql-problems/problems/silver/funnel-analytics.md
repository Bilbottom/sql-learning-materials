# Funnel analytics ⏬

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> A bank is interested in understanding the conversion rates of their mortgage application process.
>
> Their application funnel consists of the following stages, in order:
>
> 1. Full application
> 2. Decision
> 3. Documentation
> 4. Valuation inspection
> 5. Valuation made
> 6. Valuation submitted
> 7. Solicitation
> 8. Funds released

> [!QUESTION]
>
> The table `applications` tracks the dates that each mortgage application reached each stage.
>
> Calculate the conversion rates between each stage for each cohort (defined below).
>
> The output should have a row per cohort and stage, with the columns:
>
> - `cohort` as the month that the applications were started; e.g., an application started on `2024-01-15` would be cohort `2024-01`.
> - `stage`
> - `mortgages` as the number of mortgages that reached the stage
> - `step_rate` as the percentage of mortgages that reached the stage compared to the previous stage
> - `total_rate` as the percentage of mortgages that reached the stage compared to the first stage
>
> Note that each cohort should have _all_ the stages, even if there are no mortgages that reached that stage -- the `mortgages` column should be `0` in that case.
>
> Order the output by `cohort` and _the `stage` order_ (e.g. `full application` should come before `decision`, and so on).
