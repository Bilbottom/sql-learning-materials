# Predicting values ðŸŽ±

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> Some students are studying [Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) and have been asked to predict the `y` values for a given set of `x` values for each of the four datasets using [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression).

> [!QUESTION]
>
> For each of the four datasets in Anscombe's quartet, use linear regression to predict the `y` values for `x` values `16`, `17`, and `18`.
>
> The output should have a row for each `x` value (`16`, `17`, `18`), with the columns:
>
> - `x`
> - `dataset_1` as the predicted value for dataset 1, rounded to 1 decimal place
> - `dataset_2` as the predicted value for dataset 2, rounded to 1 decimal place
> - `dataset_3` as the predicted value for dataset 3, rounded to 1 decimal place
> - `dataset_4` as the predicted value for dataset 4, rounded to 1 decimal place
>
> Order the output by `x`.

There are plenty of resources online that walk through the maths behind linear regression, such as:

>? TIP: **Hint 1**

> Unpivot the datasets so that you have a table with headers `dataset`, `x`, and `y`, then apply the linear regression, and finally pivot the results back.

> For databases that support them, use the `regr_slope` and `regr_intercept` functions (or equivalent) to calculate the slope and intercept of the regression line. Otherwise, you'll need to calculate these manually ðŸ˜„
