# Customer sales running totals ðŸ“ˆ

> [!QUESTION]
>
> Using _only_ the `Sales.SalesOrderHeader` table in the [AdventureWorks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure) database, calculate the running total of `TotalDue` per customer for the customers with `CustomerID` values of `11176`, `11091`, and `11287`.
>
> The output should have a row per customer for each day in June 2014, but the running totals should include all the historic sales for the customers.
>
> The output should have 90 rows (30 days in June for 3 customers) and the columns:
>
> - `BalanceDate` as the date that the end-of-day balance corresponds to
> - `CustomerID`
> - `RunningTotal` as the sum of the `TotalDue` values up to and including the `BalanceDate`
>
> Order the output by `BalanceDate` and `CustomerID`.

Since the rows corresponding to 2014-06-01 should include the historic sales, the rows for 2014-06-01 should be:

| BalanceDate | CustomerID | RunningTotal |
| :---------- | ---------: | -----------: |
| 2014-06-01  |      11091 |    1243.5234 |
| 2014-06-01  |      11176 |    1222.8820 |
| 2014-06-01  |      11287 |    1115.2109 |

However, you should calculate this yourself (don't just copy the above values).

> Use a [recursive CTE](../../../from-excel-to-sql/advanced-concepts/recursive-ctes.md) (or equivalent) to generate the June 2014 date axis, and then join the customers' sales to it.
