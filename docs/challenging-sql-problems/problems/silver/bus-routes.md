# Bus routes ðŸšŒ

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> A transport company records their bus routes in a table where each row represents a leg of a journey, but they want to know the full route for each bus.

> [!QUESTION]
>
> Compute the full route for each bus.
>
> Use the following stops as the first stop for each bus:
>
> - `Old Street` for `bus_id = 1`
> - `Hillside` for `bus_id = 2`
> - `Birch Park` for `bus_id = 3`
>
> The output should have a single row per bus with the columns:
>
> - `bus_id`
> - `route` which is each bus stop in the route separated by a hyphen, e.g. `First Stop - Middle Stop - Final Stop`
>
> Order the output by `bus_id`.

> Use a [recursive CTE](../../../from-excel-to-sql/advanced-concepts/recursive-ctes.md) to put the bus stops in order for each bus.

> These routes are cyclical, so include a condition to stop the recursion when you reach the first stop for each bus again.
