# Metric correlation ðŸ”€

> [!SUCCESS] Scenario
>
> A company has banded their customers into segments and calculated several metrics for each customer.
>
> The company wants to know which pairs of metrics are most correlated within each segment.

> [!QUESTION]
>
> For each customer segment, find the highest correlated pair of metrics.
>
> The correlation should be rounded to four decimal places, and the output should keep ties in the (rounded) correlation. Don't compare a metric to itself ðŸ˜„
>
> The output should have a row per segment and metric pair, with the columns:
>
> - `segment`
> - `metric_pair` as the metric pair in the format `metric_1, metric_2`. Put the ([lexicographically](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/wf5s2e/eli5_what_are_lexicographical_order_in_computer/)) lower metric name on the left using your database's default [collation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4538738/8213085)
> - `correlation` as the correlation between the two metrics, rounded to four decimal places
>
> Order the output by `segment` and `metric_pair`.

>? TIP: **Hint 1**
>
> Use a correlation function, usually called `CORR`, to calculate the correlation between two metrics.
>
> If you're using a database that doesn't have a built-in correlation function, you can try to calculate it manually -- but I'd instead recommend skipping this question.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
>? TIP: **Hint 2**
>
> To get every pair of metrics "side by side" for the `CORR` function, unpivot the table so that each metric is in its own row and then join the resulting table to itself on the `segment` and `customer_id` columns.
