One of the hardest parts about starting with SQL is actually getting _somewhere_ to write the SQL.

This is complex because SQL isn't just a single language -- there are _loads_ of different SQL dialects and lots of different ways to "do SQL".

This guide will take you through the options and help you figure out which option would be best for you.

## Outline
