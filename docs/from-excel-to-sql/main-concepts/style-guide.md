## SQL style is a contentious topic...

Anyone who has written SQL for a little while will find the style that they like, and they'll typically want to stick to it (for better or worse) üòù

There are plenty of conflicting styles out there, so this guide is just to recommend the style for things that _most_ people agree on.

## Some general rules

### Use consistent capitalisation

The capitalisation that you use for your column names and table names should match their case in the database.

For example, the AdventureWorks database uses [Pascal case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pascal_case#English) for its table names, so you should use Pascal case in your SQL:

```sql
/* Good */
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person
WHERE BusinessEntityID < 5
;

/* Bad */
SELECT firstName, LASTNAME
FROM person.PERSON
WHERE businessentityid < 5
;
```

The capitalisation that you use for your SQL keywords (e.g. `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) should be consistent, and should match the standards of your team (if you have one).

```sql
/* Good, if your team use uppercase */
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person
WHERE BusinessEntityID < 5
;

/* Good, if your team use lowercase */
select FirstName, LastName
from Person.Person
where BusinessEntityID < 5
;

/* Bad */
SELECT FirstName, LastName
from Person.Person
WhEre BusinessEntityID < 5
;
```

### Put new clauses on new lines

The main clauses (e.g. `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`) should be on new lines:

```sql
/* Good */
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Person.Person
WHERE BusinessEntityID < 5
;

/* Bad */
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM
Person.Person WHERE
BusinessEntityID < 5;

/* Bad */
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Person.Person WHERE BusinessEntityID < 5;
```

### Put lists on indented new lines

For long lists of items (the length of "long" is contentious), put each item on a new line and indent it:

```sql
/* Good */
SELECT
    BusinessEntityID,
    PersonType,
    Title,
    FirstName,
    MiddleName,
    LastName
FROM Person.Person
WHERE BusinessEntityID < 20
  AND PersonType = 'EM'
  AND MiddleName IS NOT NULL
  AND EmailPromotion = 2
;

/* Bad */
SELECT BusinessEntityID, PersonType, Title, FirstName, MiddleName, LastName
FROM Person.Person
WHERE BusinessEntityID < 20 AND PersonType = 'EM' AND MiddleName IS NOT NULL AND EmailPromotion = 2
;
```
