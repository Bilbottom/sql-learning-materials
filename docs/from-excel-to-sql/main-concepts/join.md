## The `JOIN` clause combines data from tables

To get data from another table in Excel, you'd likely use one of the `LOOKUP` functions:

- [`VLOOKUP`](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1)
- [`HLOOKUP`](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/hlookup-function-a3034eec-b719-4ba3-bb65-e1ad662ed95f)
- [`XLOOKUP`](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/xlookup-function-b7fd680e-6d10-43e6-84f9-88eae8bf5929)

These functions keep your data in the same shape as the original table, but they pull in data from another table based on a common value.

In SQL, we use the `JOIN` clause to do a similar thing. The `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows between tables based on a related column between them (usually).

In Microsoft SQL Server, there are a few different types of `JOIN` clauses:

- [`INNER JOIN`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql#inner)
- [`LEFT JOIN`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql#left--outer-)
- [`RIGHT JOIN`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql#right--outer-)
- [`FULL JOIN`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql#full--outer-)
- [`CROSS JOIN`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql#cross-join)

We'll only cover the `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` in this course, but you can find more information on the others in the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql#join-type).

### The `JOIN` syntax

To add a join to a query, you need to add the `JOIN` clause after the `FROM` clause and before the `WHERE` clause. We also need to tell SQL how these tables are related using the `ON` clause, for example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM HumanResources.Employee
    INNER JOIN HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartment
        ON Employee.BusinessEntityID = vEmployeeDepartment.BusinessEntityID
;
```

This is a fairly intuitive example:

- The "base" table (in the `FROM` clause) is `HumanResources.Employee` which has the employee information.
- The "joined" table (in the `INNER JOIN` clause) is `HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartment` which has the employee's current department.
- The relationship between the two tables is that the `BusinessEntityID` in the `Employee` table matches the `BusinessEntityID` in the `vEmployeeDepartment` table. This would be similar to the `VLOOKUP` function in Excel where the `Employee.BusinessEntityID` is the lookup value and the `vEmployeeDepartment.BusinessEntityID` is the lookup column.

Notice how we've had to prefix the `BusinessEntityID` with the table name in the `ON` clause. This is because both tables have this column, so SQL needs us to prefix them to know which one we're referring to.

When we join tables, we don't usually want to `SELECT *` like we have above. Instead, we explicitly list the columns we want to see from each table:

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.BusinessEntityID,
    Employee.NationalIDNumber,
    vEmployeeDepartment.FirstName,
    vEmployeeDepartment.LastName,
    vEmployeeDepartment.Department,
    vEmployeeDepartment.JobTitle
FROM HumanResources.Employee
    LEFT JOIN HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartment
        ON Employee.BusinessEntityID = vEmployeeDepartment.BusinessEntityID
;
```

| BusinessEntityID | NationalIDNumber | FirstName | LastName   | Department  | JobTitle                      |
| ---------------: | :--------------- | :-------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------------------------- |
|                1 | 295847284        | Ken       | SÃ¡nchez    | Executive   | Chief Executive Officer       |
|                2 | 245797967        | Terri     | Duffy      | Engineering | Vice President of Engineering |
|                3 | 509647174        | Roberto   | Tamburello | Engineering | Engineering Manager           |
|                4 | 112457891        | Rob       | Walters    | Tool Design | Senior Tool Designer          |
|                5 | 695256908        | Gail      | Erickson   | Engineering | Design Engineer               |

> [!TIP]
>
> Although you only _need_ to prefix the columns that are ambiguous (exist in both tables), it's a good idea to prefix _all_ columns in a query when there's a join. This makes it easier to read and understand the query, and it can help avoid errors if the tables change in the future.

### We can alias/rename tables like we can with columns

When the table names are long, it can be helpful to give them a shorter name for the rest of the query. The way that we do this is identical to how we alias columns by using the `AS` keyword:

```sql
SELECT
    Emp.BusinessEntityID,
    Emp.NationalIDNumber,
    Dep.FirstName,
    Dep.LastName,
    Dep.Department,
    Dep.JobTitle
FROM HumanResources.Employee AS Emp
    LEFT JOIN HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartment AS Dep
        ON Emp.BusinessEntityID = Dep.BusinessEntityID
;
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Although you can alias the tables to whatever you want, please try to make the alias meaningful. This makes the query easier to read and understand!

## Step-by-step examples

We've just seen the `LEFT JOIN` clause in action, but let's break it down a bit more with some examples.

For these examples, we'll use the following fake tables:

`Employee`

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: |
|          1 | Alice        |            1 |
|          2 | Bob          |            1 |
|          3 | Charlie      |            2 |
|          4 | Dave         |            2 |
|          5 | Eve          |            3 |

`Department`

| DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| -----------: | :------------- |
|            1 | Sales          |
|            2 | Marketing      |

`Address`

| EmployeeID | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| ---------: | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
|          1 | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |
|          2 | 2 Rocky Road  | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |
|          5 | 5 Log Lane    | 2009-11-19 | 2020-03-15 |
|          5 | 6 Claw Close  | 2023-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

### `Employee LEFT JOIN Department`

Suppose we write a query that `LEFT JOIN`s the `Department` table onto the `Employee` table using the `DepartmentID`:

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Employee.DepartmentID,
    Department.DepartmentName
FROM Employee
    LEFT JOIN Department
        ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
;
```

Since the `Employee` table is the "base" table (it's in the `FROM` clause), let's break down what's happening with each row in this table.

#### Employee 1

The first row is employee 1:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: |
|          1 | Alice        |            1 |

We're joining the `Department` table to this on the `DepartmentID` column, specifically:

```sql
ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
```

This means that the information we get from the `Department` table will be where the `DepartmentID` in the `Department` table matches the `DepartmentID` in the `Employee` table which, in this case, is 1:

|     | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| --- | -----------: | :------------- |
| â†’   |            1 | Sales          |
|     |            2 | Marketing      |

That means that we take the `Sales` value from this table for the first row of the `Employee` table:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- |
|          1 | Alice        |            1 | Sales          |

This is just like a lookup in Excel!

#### Employee 2

The second row is employee 2:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: |
|          2 | Bob          |            1 |

Bob has the same `DepartmentID` as Alice, so the steps for Bob are the same as they were for Alice -- we get the `Sales` value from the `Department` table:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- |
|          2 | Bob          |            1 | Sales          |

#### Employee 3

The third row is employee 3:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: |
|          3 | Charlie      |            2 |

This time, the `DepartmentID` is 2:

|     | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| --- | -----------: | :------------- |
|     |            1 | Sales          |
| â†’   |            2 | Marketing      |

Therefore, we get the `Marketing` value from the `Department` table for Charlie:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- |
|          3 | Charlie      |            2 | Marketing      |

#### Employee 4

The fourth row is employee 4:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: |
|          4 | Dave         |            2 |

Dave also has a `DepartmentID` of 2, so we take the `Marketing` value from the `Department` table for Dave:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- |
|          4 | Dave         |            2 | Marketing      |

#### Employee 5

The fifth row is employee 5:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: |
|          5 | Eve          |            3 |

This is an interesting case. Eve has a `DepartmentID` of 3, but there's no `DepartmentID` of 3 in the `Department` table:

|     | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| --- | -----------: | :------------- |
|     |            1 | Sales          |
|     |            2 | Marketing      |

This means that we can't find a `DepartmentName` for Eve, so we instead get a `NULL` value for the `DepartmentName`:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- |
|          5 | Eve          |            3 | NULL           |

#### Putting it all together

When we put all of these rows together, we get the following result:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- |
|          1 | Alice        |            1 | Sales          |
|          2 | Bob          |            1 | Sales          |
|          3 | Charlie      |            2 | Marketing      |
|          4 | Dave         |            2 | Marketing      |
|          5 | Eve          |            3 | _null_         |

This is how the `LEFT JOIN` clause works -- it grabs whatever data it can from the "joined" table and fills in `NULL` values where it can't find a match.

### `Employee INNER JOIN Department`

Now let's look at the `INNER JOIN` clause. We'll use the exact same query as the last example, but we'll change the `LEFT JOIN` to an `INNER JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Employee.DepartmentID,
    Department.DepartmentName
FROM Employee
    INNER JOIN Department
        ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
;
```

We could find a match for the first four rows, so they are the same as they were in the `LEFT JOIN` example:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- |
|          1 | Alice        |            1 | Sales          |
|          2 | Bob          |            1 | Sales          |
|          3 | Charlie      |            2 | Marketing      |
|          4 | Dave         |            2 | Marketing      |

However, what happens with employee 5 is different: an `INNER JOIN` _only keeps rows where there's a match_!

Since there's no match for employee 5 in the `Department` table, we don't get a row for Eve _at all_! This means that the result of the `INNER JOIN` is:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- |
|          1 | Alice        |            1 | Sales          |
|          2 | Bob          |            1 | Sales          |
|          3 | Charlie      |            2 | Marketing      |
|          4 | Dave         |            2 | Marketing      |

This is the main difference between the `LEFT JOIN` and the `INNER JOIN` clauses and is what catches a lot of people out when they're new to SQL.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're not sure which join type to use, it's usually best to start with a `LEFT JOIN` and then change it to an `INNER JOIN` when you're comfortable that you're not missing any data.

### `Employee LEFT JOIN Address`

This time, suppose we write a query that `LEFT JOIN`s the `Address` table onto the `Employee` table using the `EmployeeID`:

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Address.Address,
    Address.FromDate,
    Address.ToDate
FROM Employee
    LEFT JOIN Address
        ON Employee.EmployeeID = Address.EmployeeID
;
```

As with the last example, we'll break down what's happening with each row in the `Employee` table. We'll ignore the `DepartmentID` column in the `Employee` since we're not using it in the query.

#### Employee 1

The first row is employee 1:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName |
| ---------: | :----------- |
|          1 | Alice        |

This time, we're joining the `Address` table to this on the `EmployeeID` column, specifically:

```sql
ON Employee.EmployeeID = Address.EmployeeID
```

This means that the information we get from the `Address` table will be where the `EmployeeID` in the `Address` table matches the `EmployeeID` in the `Employee` table which, in this case, is 1:

|     | EmployeeID | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| --- | ---------: | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| â†’   |          1 | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |
|     |          2 | 2 Rocky Road  | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |
|     |          5 | 5 Log Lane    | 2009-11-19 | 2020-03-15 |
|     |          5 | 6 Claw Close  | 2023-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

That means that we take the `1 Main Street` address (plus the dates) from this table for the first row of the `Employee` table:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| ---------: | :----------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
|          1 | Alice        | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |

#### Employee 2

The second row is employee 2:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName |
| ---------: | :----------- |
|          2 | Bob          |

Bob's `EmployeeID` is 2, so we look for the address in the `Address` table where the `EmployeeID` is 2:

|     | EmployeeID | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| --- | ---------: | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
|     |          1 | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |
| â†’   |          2 | 2 Rocky Road  | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |
|     |          5 | 5 Log Lane    | 2009-11-19 | 2020-03-15 |
|     |          5 | 6 Claw Close  | 2023-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

This means that we get the `2 Rocky Road` address (plus the dates) from the `Address` table for Bob:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Address      | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| ---------: | :----------- | :----------- | :--------- | :--------- |
|          2 | Bob          | 2 Rocky Road | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |

#### Employee 3

The third row is employee 3:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName |
| ---------: | :----------- |
|          3 | Charlie      |

Charlie's `EmployeeID` is 3, so we look for the address in the `Address` table where the `EmployeeID` is 3:

|     | EmployeeID | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| --- | ---------: | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
|     |          1 | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |
|     |          2 | 2 Rocky Road  | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |
|     |          5 | 5 Log Lane    | 2009-11-19 | 2020-03-15 |
|     |          5 | 6 Claw Close  | 2023-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

Since we can't find a match for Charlie and we're using a `LEFT JOIN`, we'll get `NULL` values for the `Address` columns:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Address | FromDate | ToDate |
| ---------: | :----------- | :------ | :------- | :----- |
|          3 | Charlie      | _null_  | _null_   | _null_ |

#### Employee 4

The fourth row is employee 4:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName |
| ---------: | :----------- |
|          4 | Dave         |

Dave's `EmployeeID` is 4 which also doesn't have a match in the `Address` table, so we get `NULL` values for the `Address` columns:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Address | FromDate | ToDate |
| ---------: | :----------- | :------ | :------- | :----- |
|          4 | Dave         | _null_  | _null_   | _null_ |

#### Employee 5

The fifth row is employee 5:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName |
| ---------: | :----------- |
|          5 | Eve          |

Eve's `EmployeeID` is 5, and they have _two_ addresses in the `Address` table:

|     | EmployeeID | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| --- | ---------: | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
|     |          1 | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |
|     |          2 | 2 Rocky Road  | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |
| â†’   |          5 | 5 Log Lane    | 2009-11-19 | 2020-03-15 |
| â†’   |          5 | 6 Claw Close  | 2023-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

This is another place where SQL is different to Excel. Since we have _two_ matches for Eve in the `Address` table, we get _two_ rows in the result -- we keep both!

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Address      | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| ---------: | :----------- | :----------- | :--------- | :--------- |
|          5 | Eve          | 5 Log Lane   | 2009-11-19 | 2020-03-15 |
|          5 | Eve          | 6 Claw Close | 2023-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

#### Putting it all together

When we put all of these rows together, we get the following result:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| ---------: | :----------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
|          1 | Alice        | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |
|          2 | Bob          | 2 Rocky Road  | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |
|          3 | Charlie      | _null_        | _null_     | _null_     |
|          4 | Dave         | _null_        | _null_     | _null_     |
|          5 | Eve          | 5 Log Lane    | 2009-11-19 | 2020-03-15 |
|          5 | Eve          | 6 Claw Close  | 2023-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

> [!WARNING]
>
> In Excel, you'd only get one row for Eve (Excel would just keep the _first_ match), but in SQL you get _all_ the matches. This is a common source of confusion for people new to SQL.
>
> However, this behaviour is super useful when used correctly! Just keep an eye out for it.

### `Employee INNER JOIN Address`

To finish off, let's consider the same query but with an `INNER JOIN` instead of a `LEFT JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Address.Address,
    Address.FromDate,
    Address.ToDate
FROM Employee
    INNER JOIN Address
        ON Employee.EmployeeID = Address.EmployeeID
;
```

Can you guess what the result will be?

It's the same as the `LEFT JOIN` example, but without rows for Charlie and Dave since they don't have a match in the `Address` table using this condition:

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |

## `LEFT JOIN` is probably the most common join type

Since the `INNER JOIN` will drop rows that don't have a match in the "joined" table, it's usually "safer" to use `LEFT JOIN` to make sure that you don't accidentally lose any data during the join.

This is common practice (favouring `LEFT` over `INNER`), so you'll often see people use `LEFT JOIN` unless they have a specific reason to use a different type.

## `INNER JOIN` is the default join type

If you don't specify `LEFT` or `INNER` (or any of the others), then SQL will default to an `INNER JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Employee.DepartmentID,
    Department.DepartmentName
FROM Employee
    JOIN Department  /* This will be an `INNER JOIN` */
        ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
;
```

Although this is the default, it's _always_ a good idea to be explicit about the join type you're using. This makes the query easier to read and understand, and it can help avoid errors if the tables change in the future.

## There can be several joins in a single query

The examples above have just been joining two tables, but you can join as many tables as you like in a single query.

For example, we could combine the `Employee`, `Department`, and `Address` tables in a single query:

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Employee.DepartmentID,
    Department.DepartmentName,
    Address.Address,
    Address.FromDate,
    Address.ToDate
FROM Employee
    LEFT JOIN Department
        ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
    LEFT JOIN Address
        ON Employee.EmployeeID = Address.EmployeeID
;
```

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
|          1 | Alice        |            1 | Sales          | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |
|          2 | Bob          |            1 | Sales          | 2 Rocky Road  | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |
|          3 | Charlie      |            2 | Marketing      | null          | null       | null       |
|          4 | Dave         |            2 | Marketing      | null          | null       | null       |
|          5 | Eve          |            3 | null           | 5 Log Lane    | 2009-11-19 | 2020-03-15 |
|          5 | Eve          |            3 | null           | 6 Claw Close  | 2020-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

Notice how, although the `Employee` table only has five rows, we've ended up with six because of the (`LEFT`) join with the `Address` table.

Similarly, can you guess what the output would be if we used `INNER JOIN`s instead of `LEFT JOIN`s?

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Employee.DepartmentID,
    Department.DepartmentName,
    Address.Address,
    Address.FromDate,
    Address.ToDate
FROM Employee
    INNER JOIN Department
        ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
    INNER JOIN Address
        ON Employee.EmployeeID = Address.EmployeeID
;
```

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | DepartmentID | DepartmentName | Address       | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| ---------: | :----------- | -----------: | :------------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
|          1 | Alice        |            1 | Sales          | 1 Main Street | 2001-07-21 | 2002-10-30 |
|          2 | Bob          |            1 | Sales          | 2 Rocky Road  | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |

We'd only get two rows! We'd lose the rows for Charlie and Dave in the join with the `Address` table, and we'd lose the row(s) for Eve in the join with the `Department` table.

> [!INFO]

> You can use whichever join types you want for each join, there's no need to use all the same (e.g. all `LEFT` join).

## Other tips and tricks

The examples above are "typical" examples of joins, but you'll find that you can use joins in a lot of different ways!

### You can use any condition in a join

We've just been using the `=` operator in the `ON` clause, but you can use any condition you like (and as many as you want!).

For example, we could also filter on the dates in the `Address` table when we join it to the `Employee` table:

```sql
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Address.Address,
    Address.FromDate,
    Address.ToDate
FROM Employee
    INNER JOIN Address
        ON  Employee.EmployeeID = Address.EmployeeID
        AND Address.FromDate >= '2010-01-01'
;
```

| EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Address      | FromDate   | ToDate     |
| ---------: | :----------- | :----------- | :--------- | :--------- |
|          2 | Bob          | 2 Rocky Road | 2012-07-04 | 2018-02-11 |
|          5 | Eve          | 6 Claw Close | 2020-03-16 | 2024-12-31 |

### Tables can be joined to themselves

There's nothing stopping you from joining a table to itself! This can be useful when you want to compare rows within the same table, but this is pretty rare, so we won't cover it in this course.

## The SQL for running these examples

> [!ERROR]
>
> The data for these examples isn't in the AdventureWorks database that we're using, so it has been created for this section. If you want to run these examples yourself, you can adjust the SQL below. Note that this is using some features that we haven't covered yet!

For the examples above, the rows are created on the fly. You're not expected to understand this yet, but it's provided so that you can run the SQL yourself if you want to.

```sql
WITH

Employee AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM (
        VALUES
            (1, 'Alice',   1),
            (2, 'Bob',     1),
            (3, 'Charlie', 2),
            (4, 'Dave',    2),
            (5, 'Eve',     3)
    ) AS V(EmployeeID, EmployeeName, DepartmentID)
),

Department AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM (
        VALUES
            (1, 'Sales'),
            (2, 'Marketing')
    ) AS V(DepartmentID, DepartmentName)
),

Address AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM (
        VALUES
            (1, '1 Main Street', '2001-07-21', '2002-10-30'),
            (2, '2 Rocky Road',  '2012-07-04', '2018-02-11'),
            (5, '5 Log Lane',    '2009-11-19', '2020-03-15'),
            (5, '6 Claw Close',  '2020-03-16', '2024-12-31')
    ) AS V(EmployeeID, Address, FromDate, ToDate)
)

/* Edit this part */
SELECT
    Employee.EmployeeID,
    Employee.EmployeeName,
    Employee.DepartmentID,
    Department.DepartmentName,
    Address.Address,
    Address.FromDate,
    Address.ToDate
FROM Employee
    INNER JOIN Department
        ON Employee.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
    INNER JOIN Address
        ON Employee.EmployeeID = Address.EmployeeID
;
```

### Additional join modifiers in other SQL flavours

Microsoft SQL Server has a fairly limited number of join features, but other SQL flavours add _loads_ of additional modifiers to the `JOIN` clause.

If you see something that you don't recognise, make sure that you search for it in the documentation for the specific SQL flavour that you see the thing in!
