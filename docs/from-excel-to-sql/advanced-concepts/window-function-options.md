## Quick recap

We saw in the main concepts section that window functions are a way to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. They are similar to aggregate functions, but they don't collapse the rows into a single row.

The main syntax we saw was:

```sql
SELECT
    <WINDOW_FUNCTION>(...) OVER (
        PARTITION BY ...
        ORDER BY ...
        ROWS BETWEEN ... AND ...
    )
FROM ...
```

We saw that `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` could be used independently or together, and we also saw the `WINDOW` clause:

```sql
SELECT
    <WINDOW_FUNCTION>(...) OVER window_name
FROM ...
WINDOW window_name AS (
    PARTITION BY ...
    ORDER BY ...
    ROWS BETWEEN ... AND ...
)
```

## The `WINDOW` clause

Two things we didn't cover with the `WINDOW` clause are:

- Defining multiple window functions in a single query
- Window chaining

## Frame spec shorthands

## `RANGE` frame type

## `GROUPS` frame type

## Exclusion options

## Further reading

SQL Server doesn't actually support a few of these options, so check out the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html) for more information on window function options at:
